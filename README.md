This is a web application that shows various amenities in your local area.

The app can be visited on Surge: [Amenities-App](https://amenities-app.surge.sh)

## How To Use

1. Simply press the "My Location" button and the app will direct you to a page showcasing the nearby top rated amenities.
2. Click the slider buttons to scroll through the amenities of the currently selected category.
3. Use the sidebar buttons to switch amenity categories.
4. To see amenities outside of your area, replace the city and state in the URL with the location you want to search.
